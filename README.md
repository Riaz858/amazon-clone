This is a simple not perfectly responsive website design project where I tried to create a layout using HTML and CSS. 
The focus of this project was not on making it pixel-perfect but rather on practicing and learning responsiveness, layout techniques, and CSS properties.

## Features

- **Responsive Navbar**: A navigation bar with a logo and search functionality.
- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing hero section with a background image and a message overlay.
- **Shop Section**: A flexible product display section with adaptive layout for different screen sizes.
- **Footer**: A structured footer with links and additional information.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was purely to experiment with web development techniques and understand how responsive designs are created. It may not be pixel-perfect, but it represents a sincere effort to build a functional and visually pleasing layout.

## Future Improvements

This project is a work in progress, and I plan to improve it further with the following:
1. **Pixel Perfection**: Refine the layout to ensure it aligns perfectly across all devices.
2. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Add proper ARIA labels and semantic tags to make it more accessible.
3. **Interactive Elements**: Include JavaScript functionalities like dropdown menus or modal popups.
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test and optimize for different browsers.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Use compressed images and minified CSS for better performance.
